# Analysis of stocks: Helping Steve analyze the stock market
## Overview of Project
### Explain the purpose of this analysis

- The purpose of this analysis was to refactor the code we used during the module. We wanted to refactor it so see if we could make it run faster, smoothly, and make the code easier to read if possible.  
## Results
### Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2018 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

- At the end of the analysis, the refactored version did indeed run faster, by about .0078125 seconds. Attached are screenshots of the time difference. The refactored version was also shorter and to the point.

## Summary
### In a summary statement, address the following questions.

What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
- I personally believe this answer depends on the case. With computers getting more advanced every year, it's not like it's taking a computer 10 minutes to run an analysis and a refactored code is decreasing that time to 5 minutes. As we see here, the difference is faster than the blink of an eye. This also was a small batch of data (which still only took half a second to analyze) and I’m not familiar with how long it takes for a more complicated analysis. Regardless, a code that runs faster is always preferred, which is an advantage. 

How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
- I think the original VBA script ran smoothly, and the time it took for it to analyze the code wasn’t too long. I think it makes more sense to refactor code that is easier to read. In the future when someone refactors someone else’s work, being able to easily read the code is crucial (which is one big thing we have learned so far. Clean and easy to read code is important). I don’t think there were a vast selection of pros and cons to choose from for refactoring this VBA code.
